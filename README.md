# HuffmanCoding
  My implementation of huffman coding
  
  Huffman coding is a lossless data compression technique for reducing the number of bits needed to send and/or store a given text. It's concept is based on assigning frequently appearing characters with shorter bit representations and least frequently appearing characters with longer representations. An entropy is calculated at the end. Entropy is the expected value (average) of the information contained in the text. The entropy of a message is its amount of uncertainty.
